            <p>
                if you want to apply certain styles to multiple pages you can use an external css page
                to link a css style sheet to a html page you place the tags<br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="page_link.css" type="text/css"/&gt;<br>
                in the html page 
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3 class="sect_header">Using Class and ID</h3>
            <p>
                you can place a number of related elements into (e.g. the headers of each of these 
                sections) into a set called a class in order to apply styles to all of them at the same time
                to signify you are apply styles to a class in a css document you prefix the name with a "."<br><br>
                if you have a single unique element you want to place seperate style onto you can give them and id 
                to signify you are applying styles to an id in a css document you prefix the name with a "#"
